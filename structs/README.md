# Introduction

`Structs` are similar to `tuples` but unlike `tuples`, you'll name each piece of data in `structs`. As a result of this, order becomes a non-necessity in case of `structs`. To define a `struct` use the `struct` keyword. `Tuple structs` are `structs` without any `names`. To use `references` in `structs`, one has to use the concept of `lifetime`, otherwise the option is to use owned data types like `String`.
