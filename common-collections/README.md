# Introductions

Rust's standard library contains a number very useful data structures called `collections`. They can contain multiple values and is stored on the heap, which means the data can shrink or grow as the program runs. Three most common `collections` are:

- `vector`: It allows you to store variable number of values next to each other.
- `string`: It is a collection of characters(`String` type)
- `hashmap`: Particular implementation of a more generic data structure `map`.
