## Introduction
`generics` are abstract stand-ins for concrete types to handle code duplication.
They along with `traits` are used to specify `function bounds`. That means they
place restrictions on the return types and on the types of parameters in the 
function.

## Sample Example Problem
Write a function that will return the largest item given a list.
